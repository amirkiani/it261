    <h1>Welcome to Ameer Kiani's Portal Page for IT261 - Fall 2020!</h1>
    <p>Hello, I moved to Seattle in spring of 2019. After working with several non-profit organizations and studying business administration, I decided to make a career change. I'm pursuing a programming degree with sub-tracks in web development and mobile development. I'm proud to be an Associate in the Associated Student Council this year and a member of Phi Theta Kappa. I will complete my Associate's degree in June and plan on transferring to North Seattle College to complete the B.A.S. in Mobile Development in fall of 2021. My ultimate goal is to create a fitness and wellness app with my brother.</p>
